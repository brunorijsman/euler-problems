Right triangle with integer sides a, b, c implies

a >= 1

b >= 1

c >= 1

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

To avoid solutions which differ only in ordering of a, b, c:

a < b < c

Perimeter is p implies

a + b + c = p

a = p - b - c

Let a vary from 1 ... p - 2

b = p - a - c

Let b vary from a ... p - a - 1 

c = p - a - b

C is fixed

Check if a^2 + b^2 = c^2
